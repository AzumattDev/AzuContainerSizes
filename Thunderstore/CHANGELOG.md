| 1.1.3     | - Change how I approach container sizing. Containers now dynamically resize to accommodate any items that end up outside their configured grid size. If items occupy overflow slots, the container will expand to fit them and stay at that size until those overflow items are removed. Previously, overflow items would spawn on the ground next to the chest. That no longer happens. Chests will now try to keep all items by resizing to include the overflow slots instead of dropping them. |
| 1.1.3     | - Truly prevent item loss. Fix issues in last update.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1.1.2     | - Prevent item loss when accidentally (or on purpose) changing the configuration to have less slots in a chest than there are items. Items will spawn next to the chest that became invalid. The path is attempt to stack to existing -> find empty slot -> if nothing, drop next to container.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
